    <h2 class="my-3">About me</h2>
    <p class="my-3">
      Hey! My name is Ian and I'm a full-stack developer. I love building
      building things that live on the internet and I strive to deliver products
      where development and design come together to provide intuitive UX with
      streamlined programs.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      Right now my main focus is creating software solutions with the amazing
      team at MemoryShare in Dallas, Texas and working on one of my many side
      projects. I find that working on web based projects fuels my creative
      drive and helps keep me update to date on the rapid expansion of developer
      tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.
    </p>

    <p class="my-3">
      I'm a big fan of pop punk, stand-up comedy, experimenting with tech, and
      watching great movies.

    Hey! I'm a Full-Stack Developer currently located in Dallas, Tx. Before
    finding my passion in web development, I studied graphic design and
    understand the impact a great design can have. I strive to deliver products
    where development and design come together to provide intuitive UX with
    streamlined programs. As an aircraft mechanic, I learned to sharpen my
    attention to detail and I use that skill everyday to tackle any problems
    that need solving. If I'm not grinding through code, I can be found laying
    down some tasty licks on my guitar or exploring the city. -->
